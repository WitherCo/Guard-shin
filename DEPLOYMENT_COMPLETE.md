   ```

2. **Run the Deployment Script**
   ```bash
   ./deploy_render.sh
   ```

3. **Monitor Deployment**
   - The script will provide a URL to monitor your deployment
   - Once deployed, your bot should come online in Discord

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Port Binding Issues**: Make sure PORT=8080 is set and the bot is binding to 0.0.0.0
2. **Bot Not Coming Online**: Check the logs in Render for any errors
3. **Dashboard Not Loading**: Allow 5-10 minutes for GitHub Pages to update

## Monitoring Your Bot

We've included a monitoring script that checks if your bot is online and sends notifications if it goes down:

1. **Set Up Monitoring**
   ```bash
   # Set the URL to your deployed Render service
   export RENDER_SERVICE_URL=https://your-bot-url.onrender.com
   
   # Start the monitoring script
   node monitor_bot.js &
   ```

2. **What the Monitor Does**
   - Checks your bot's health every 5 minutes
   - Sends notifications to your Discord webhook if the bot goes down
   - Logs all checks to `monitor.log`

## Next Steps

1. Test your bot's functionality in a Discord server
2. Verify all dashboard pages are working correctly
3. Set up the monitoring script to ensure reliable operation
